npm install --legacy-peer-deps --no-optional

# Or use yarn
yarn install

# Or use pnpm
pnpm install
```

### Option 2: Manual dependency installation
```bash
# Install only essential packages one by one
npm install next@14.2.0

# Install yarn and try with it
npm install -g yarn
yarn install
yarn dev
```
